# =============================================================================
# Let us discuss the formula for compound interest. The formula to calculate compound interest annually is given by: 
# 
# A = P(1 + R/100) t 
# 
# Compound Interest = A â€“ P 
# 
# Where, 
# A is amount 
# P is the principal amount 
# R is the rate and 
# T is the time span
